// Which bodies might touch, and what each such pair remembers.
//
// BROADPHASE. Testing every body against every other is n² tests; a pile of
// 5,000 shards is 12 million a step, nearly all of them between bodies nowhere
// near each other. So each body sits in a tree of boxes (tree.js, 3D's, used
// as it is with every box of no depth), in a FAT box a little bigger than it.
// While it stays inside that box nothing changes, so most steps touch the tree
// not at all. A body that leaves it is put back and asked what it now overlaps.
// Static bodies have a tree of their own, since nothing needs to ask them
// anything. The box doesn't reach ahead of the body, as 3D's does (AHEAD,
// broadphase.js), which suits a metre-wide crate: an 8 px shard falling 16
// steps ahead has a box 20 times itself, touching everything near it long after
// it stops. Measured on 5,000 shards landing: 105 ms a step and 210 pairs a
// shard with it, 25 ms and 10 pairs without, and a reach held to the body's own
// size was worse the longer it was.
//
// PAIRS are kept from step to step: a pair stays listed while its fat boxes
// overlap, and holds what it pushed with, so a stack starts each step from what
// held it (the warm start). `active` pairs come first; a pair of two sleeping
// bodies sits past them, and costs nothing.
//
// Each body keeps its pairs on a list threaded through the pair rows, an edge
// 2p for the pair's a and 2p + 1 for its b, so waking a body or dropping one
// walks only its own pairs, and finding a pair is a walk of a few.
