// Where two flat shapes touch.
//
// One routine for every pair, because every shape is the same thing: a convex
// CORE of 1, 2 or more corners, and a RADIUS rounding it. A box or a polygon
// is its corners with radius 0; a circle one point; a capsule a line. So "how
// far apart" is always the distance between cores less the two radii, and
// there are no special cases by shape (Box2D 3 builds its capsules and rounded
// polygons the same way).
//
// A contact is a MANIFOLD: one direction, the normal, from a to b, and one or
// two points, each with a separation, negative when overlapping. Two points
// because a box lying on a floor is held at two places: at one it would tip.
// Points a little apart are kept too, "speculative" ones: the solver lets them
// close to exactly touching, so a fast body stops at a surface, not past it.
//
// Finding it, three cases:
//
//   apart     the cores don't overlap, so the nearest points of the two say
//             the normal. If the two are near flat against each other, a side
//             of one is the reference: clipped, below, for two points. Else
//             they meet corner on, at one point.
//   overlap   the side of least overlap is the reference (separating axes:
//             two convex shapes are apart if some side of one has every
//             corner of the other past it, and if none does, the side that
//             comes nearest says how to part them).
//   clip      the reference side's slab cuts the other shape's most facing
//             side down to the part over it. Its two ends are the points.
//
// Points are named by the corner they sit at, whichever shape is the
// reference, so a point keeps its name, and its warm start, when two near-flat
// shapes swap which is the reference (the buzzing that cost the 3D solver a
// ragdoll; see SWAPPED in ../collide.js).
