All notable changes to Bearing are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), measured against the
[API reference](docs/API.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Bodies moving together no longer find contacts between them, in 3D and 2D. A pair not in touch
  looked ahead for a contact by the sum of each body's own speed, so boxes falling side by side at
  10 m/s were taken to close at 20 m/s, and every neighbour in a falling crowd had a contact found
  and solved. Such a pair now looks ahead by how fast the two close on each other: their speed
  against each other, gravity only where it pulls them differently, damping and spin. Pairs
  already touching keep the old reach, which also holds their contact while a resting body rocks by
  a hair (with the new reach for them too, 8 of 360 mixed heaps were still awake at 40 s, against 2).
  4,000 boxes falling in 3D step 6 times as fast, 2,000 in 2D 3 times; a landing 2D pile is 12%
  faster and sleeps sooner; 3D stacks, pyramids and piles are unchanged to the bit, hull heaps 1%
  faster. A 2D body's own look-ahead, which files it in the broadphase, now counts its
  `gravityScale`, as 3D's did. Results change wherever moving bodies near each other aren't touching.
- Fast bodies in open space step far faster in 3D. After the solve, every body that moved more
  than half its size in a step is swept along its path to catch it going through something, and
  each sweep walked the broadphase's trees even with nothing near: 10,000 boxes 0.3 m wide flying
  at up to 17 m/s spent 90% of their step there. A fast body with no candidate pair, no joint, and
  a path inside its own broadphase box now skips that walk, since anything it could meet would be
  its pair. Those 10,000 step in 16 ms rather than 72, with the same results to the bit.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-11-11

Two speed-ups from an audit, with no change to the API. Ragdolls and other jointed bodies lying
still in a heap where something else still moves now stop being simulated, a whole tree of joints
at a time, as unjointed bodies already did; and small worlds no longer pay a fixed cost for the
solve order's sort. Saves are unchanged, still format 20.

### Changed

- Bodies held together by joints now freeze, as a whole tree at a time: a ragdoll lying still in a
  heap where something else still moves stops being simulated, and starts again with its whole
  tree. Before, a jointed body never froze, so 32 ragdolls fallen in heaps, each heap kept awake by
  one forearm swinging on a frictionless hinge, had 255 of their 264 awake parts simulated though
  still; from 8 s they now step in 4.2 to 6.6 ms rather than 7 to 11. A frozen joint keeps its
  last `force` and `torque`, as a sleeping one does. See [Sleeping](docs/API.md#sleeping).
- Small worlds step faster: the solve order's sort no longer clears and sums a table of 4,096
  counts every step whatever the world's size, but sorts up to 128 contacts by insertion and sizes
  its tables by the bodies in use. A box resting alone steps in half the time, a 10-box stack 11
  to 13% faster, a sleeping 1,000-box pile 4%; results are the same to the bit.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-11-10

Cylinders: wheels, logs, barrels and coins, round one way and flat the other. They roll on their
side, stand on their ends and catch on their rims, against every shape and on any ground, and a
car on cylinder wheels crosses a heightfield at 20 m/s with every wheel down. Saves are now format
20; nothing else changes for worlds without cylinders.

### Added

- Cylinders: `shape: 'cylinder'`, with a `radius` and a `height` along the body's own y, for bodies
  and compound parts. They collide with every shape, meshes and heightfields included, roll on
  their side, stand on their ends and catch on their rims, float, and are seen by rays, casts and
  overlaps. A wheel joint's wheel can be one, turned so its y is the axle: a car on four crosses a
  heightfield at 20 m/s with every wheel on the ground. See [Cylinders](docs/API.md#cylinders).
  A body's shape codes moved to make room, so saves are now format 20.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-11-10

The kit: water, wheels, pieces and soft bodies, the physics a game reaches for beyond rigid
bodies, each inside the same substeps as the solver. Boxes of water float what is in them as
Archimedes says; a wheel joint holds a car's wheels on their suspension; `fracture()` cuts a box or
hull into pieces that fill it exactly; and soft bodies are cloth, flags and closed shapes that keep
their volume, colliding with every rigid body both ways. Joints with stops and bodies resting on
terrain step faster, and a capsule leaning on what it rests on no longer buzzes. Saves are now
format 19, and results change where capsules or bodies on meshes rest.

### Added

- Water: a static or kinematic box given `fluid: true` holds up every dynamic body in it by the
  weight of the water it displaces, at the centre of the part of it under the surface, so a body
  of half water's density floats half under and a plank rights itself and floats flat. The
  water's `density`, `damping` and `angularDamping` (3 each for new water unless given) and its
  `flow`, a current, set how it holds and carries what is in it. Water is a sensor, so nothing
  collides with it, and water added, moved or taken away wakes what it covers. See
  [Water](docs/API.md#water).
- Wheels: a joint of type `'wheel'` holds a wheel to a chassis as a car's suspension does. The
  wheel slides along `axis` on a spring (`frequency`, `dampingRatio`, between `min` and `max`) and
  spins about the new option `axle`, driven and braked by its motor; steering is turning `axle`
  with `setJoint`, which keeps what the wheel holds. A car on four of them crosses a heightfield
  or a mesh at 20 m/s with every wheel on the ground. See [Joints](docs/API.md#joints). Saves are
  now format 18.
- Pieces: `fracture(shape, { count, seed })`, exported beside `readGlb`, cuts a box or a hull
  into `count` convex pieces that fill it exactly, face to face, each `{ vertices, position }`
  ready for `addBody({ shape: 'hull', ... })`. A seed gives the same pieces on every machine. When
  something breaks is the game's to say: remove the body and add the pieces. See
  [Pieces](docs/API.md#pieces).
- Soft bodies: `world.addSoftBody`, `setSoftBody`, `softBodyOf` and `softBody(id)`, and the
  `SoftBody` handle, exported beside `Body` and `Joint`, with `positions`, its corners, written by
  every step. An open mesh is cloth; a closed one given `pressure` keeps its volume. `stretch` and
  `bend` say how stiff it is, the same at any size or mesh spacing; `attach` pins corners to bodies
  or the world; `wind` is the air around it, which pushes each triangle as a flat plate. It
  collides with every rigid body, both ways, with friction, and sleeps and wakes as bodies do. A
  cloth hung by its edge hangs its own length however fine its mesh, a flag waves on its pole, a
  cloth drapes over a crate and sleeps, and a ball keeps its volume to 1.5% as it lands. See
  [Soft bodies](docs/API.md#soft-bodies). `world.remove` takes a soft body too. Saves are now
  format 19.

### Changed

- Joints with stops are faster, to the same bits: ball joints and hinges in a tree, and rotation
  joints with a cone, work out what depends only on where the bodies are 9 times a step, not 16.
  100 driven ragdolls with stops step 14% faster on one thread, ragdolls with stops and no motors
  1 to 5%.
- Bodies resting on a mesh or a heightfield keep their contacts from step to step while they have
  barely moved, as bodies resting on each other already did, instead of testing every triangle
  under them again. A pile settling on terrain steps 6 to 9% faster over its first 12 s, and on a
  level mesh 14 to 15%. Results change slightly where such a body rests, by no more than a fresh
  look at the triangles may be off.

### Fixed

- A capsule leaning against what it rests on could have the contact it kept from the last step
  rebuilt too deep, by its radius times the square of the lean, and be kicked up by it. On a mesh
  or heightfield, a capsule lying across a peak buzzed in place for good (4 to 6 heaps in 80); against
  a box, a hull or another capsule the same could happen where a contact wasn't at its rounded end.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-11-06

Joints that stay where they are put. A jointed body given a new shape keeps its joints on the same
points of it, and joints that can't all be held, in a ring locked solid or pulled apart by hand, no
longer run away to NaN. There is no API change and saves stay at format 15, but a save loads only
into the version that made it. Results change only where a jointed body is reshaped or joints are
past what they can hold: joints that work keep their bits. Ragdolls step 2 to 3% slower.

### Fixed

- `setBody` that moves a body's centre of mass or principal axes, with a new shape, new vertices or
  `centerOfMass`, leaves its joints where they were on the body. Each joint's anchor moved with the
  centre, and the joint then dragged the body after it, by as far as the centre had moved.
- Joints that can't all be held no longer run away. A ring of joints locked as it lands, or torn by
  hand, could multiply its speed each substep to 10^143 m/s and NaN, in 64 of 150 rings of mixed
  joints. A joint counts as torn by no more than its moving bodies reach, and as each substep
  starts, joined bodies parting faster than their reach in a substep are brought back to that speed
  about their common centre of mass, so no run of substeps can multiply. In 1,350 runs meant to
  break it, none reached NaN; 53% of random joint graphs did before. Joints that work, and machines
  thrown whole, are untouched, to the bit. It costs ragdolls 2 to 3%.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-11-06

An audit of the whole package, and what it found. Bodies no longer hang in the air when
what held them goes, whichever way it went; box characters, the default, no longer freeze when they
land; and box shape casts give the true normal and point. In 2D, large capsules collide, saw blades
and slow lifts keep moving, and long shape casts over a tilemap take milliseconds. Pairs that don't
touch are told apart sooner, for 3 to 8% on most heaps. There is no API change, and saves stay at
format 15, but a save loads only into the version that made it. 3D results change only where a
support goes or a box casts from a touch. 2D results change wherever a circle was left to sleep
while turning, so a 2D replay recorded on 1.3.2 may not match.

### Fixed

- Bodies no longer hang in the air when what held them goes. A frozen or sleeping body now wakes
  when any touch it rested on ends, however that came about: a floor removed, moved or filtered
  out, a kinematic lift moved by hand, shrunk or filtered out, or a box under it taken away.
- A static body made dynamic or kinematic moves what rested on it, or carries it, in place of
  passing through it.
- A box character no longer freezes when it lands or meets a wall. It walks, slides along walls
  and steps off ledges as a capsule does. Box is the default shape, so a character given no
  shape had this. A box touches at no distance, so a move from a touch had no direction to go by.
- `shapeCast` with a box or hull gives the true normal and point. About half of all casts gave the
  normal against the move and the point at the cast's centre; the distance was right.
- Repeated points can't break a hull any more, and a hull too thin to tell from flat is refused
  with the message a flat one gets. Either used to give a body of NaN or no mass, about 1 point set
  in 1,000 for repeats. A hull's flatness follows its size, not its distance from the origin: a rock
  given in coordinates 1,000 km out collapsed from 396 faces to 4.
- 2D: a capsule with `height` twice its `radius`, which is the default height of a large capsule,
  collides as a circle. It passed through everything.
- 2D: a circle spinning in place, and a kinematic body moving too slowly to leave its tolerance in a
  second, no longer fall asleep and lose their velocity. A saw blade stopped after 1 s.
- 2D: whatever takes a support away wakes what slept on it, as in 3D: a crate was left hanging when
  its kinematic platform was moved by hand, filtered out or shrunk.
- 2D: a touch ended by `setBody` reports its `end` after the next step. It was cleared unread.
- 2D: `shapeCast` with no `maxDistance` over a large tilemap takes milliseconds: 11 s to 1.8 ms on a
  map of 2,000 by 1,000. It walked every cell in a box as wide as the cast.
- 2D: contact storage is given back after a burst, by the quarter rule, as in 3D.

### Changed

- Small worlds pay far less for workers. A contact colour goes to the workers from 16 rows, not 4:
  with `workers: 'auto'` a 10-box stack steps in half the time (0.16 to 0.08 ms with 5 workers,
  0.21 to 0.11 ms with 1), now under its one-thread time. A world of 40 boxes still steps about a
  quarter slower with workers than without; the 210-box pyramid and 1,000-box pile are unchanged.
  Results are the same bits either way.
- The 210-box pyramid steps 2 to 3% faster on one thread: a four-point contact's right-hand side in
  the block normal solve is written out. The 1,000-box pile is unchanged. Same bits.
- `docs/API.md`: `world.substeps` says what fewer substeps gains and loses, measured: at 4, the
  pyramid steps 1.6 times as fast and sinks 29 mm in 10 s, against 7.3 mm at 8. Its note on why the
  default is 8 had figures from before milestone 16, and has today's.
- Pairs that don't touch are told apart before the full contact test, along the line between
  their centres: on a pile of 1,000 hulls 99.6% of full tests found nothing. Hulls, meshes and
  mixed heaps step 3 to 6% faster, 2D heaps 5 to 8%, and a landing box pile 3 to 4%, with a bound on
  the edge pairs of boxes meeting corner on. A 2D step makes 750 KB of garbage, down from 2.6 MB.
  Same bits.
- A joint in a tree whose stops aren't reached does nothing more than see that they aren't: ragdolls
  about 2.5% faster, and a contact pushed by nothing skips friction, rolling and twist, whose
  limits are 0: heaps of balls 4%, meshes 2.5%, the rest 1 to 2%. Same bits.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-11-05

A body pressed into a mesh or heightfield now stays on the side it was on, so a heap, a platform or
a heavy block can't push it out through the floor. Results change only where a body is pressed
past its centre, so most replays still match; a save loads only into the version that made it.

### Fixed

- A body pressed past its centre into a mesh stays on the side it was touching. A mesh has no
  inside, so which side counted was worked out from where the body's centre was, and a floor
  turned over and pushed the body down: 1 body in 53,000 fell through a mesh floor under a heap, a
  rock pressed by a platform at 3 m/s ended 2 m under, and a plate squeezed by a heavy block fell
  out. Across 240,000 bodies in heaps, 6 went through before and 1 now, that one in a fold of 10
  degrees on a mesh much rougher than ground. Bodies dropped on a sharp ridge still go down the
  same flank as on a solid ridge.
- A box or hull squeezed past its centre into a heightfield isn't pushed down through it. The
  ground is one-sided, but the body's own face or edge could still win, since the shallowest way
  out of a triangle can be the way down.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-11-05

A crash fixed in 2D, and a rocking capsule that kept 3D heaps awake. Adding and removing bodies
between steps could make a 2D world's next `step` throw. In 3D, a capsule lying nearly along what
it rests on now settles. There is no
API change and saves stay at format 15, but a save loads only into the version that made it, and
3D results change wherever capsules touch boxes or each other, so a replay recorded on 1.3.0 won't
match.

### Fixed

- **2D: a crash in `world.step` after adding and removing bodies between steps.** A slot removed
  and reused before a step was listed twice for the broadphase, so enough of them ran past the end
  of the list, and a world that shrank kept entries for slots it no longer had. Either way
  `step` threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'box')`. 3D never had this.
- **A capsule no longer rocks for good on what it lies along.** A capsule nearly side by side with
  another, along a box's edge or across a box past both its sides got one contact point, which a
  tilt of a few milliradians ran the length of the capsule. The solver pushes where a point was as
  the step began, so the push lagged the rocking and fed it, as much as rolling resistance took
  out, and the heap around it stayed awake. Such a capsule now rests on both ends of the stretch
  within the contact tolerance. Of 120 mixed heaps of 200 bodies, 2 were still awake at 40 s, from
  9, and 3 at 20 s, from 14; a step of them took about 7% less time. 3D results change wherever
  capsules touch boxes or each other. A capsule rocking on two edges at a very shallow angle can
  still keep going: that takes contacts found again within the step.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-11-04

Bearing in two dimensions, and joints and characters closer to what games ask of them. There
is a 2D module, `bearing-physics/2d`, in pixels with y down as Winding's and Godot's are: boxes,
circles, capsules, polygons and compounds, tilemaps that change as they are mined, one-sided
chains, queries, contact events, sensors and character bodies, with the same calls, options and
errors as 3D. In 3D, a ball joint's cone can be an ellipse, so a shoulder swings further forward
than up, and its edge is a rim the limb slides round. A character can push what it walks into, as
hard as it is allowed. A body can be locked along an axis as it could be about one, so a 3D scene
can be played on one plane. And the reference says why the first impact in a session is slower
than the rest, and what to do about it. Version 1.2.0 was prepared and never released: all of it is
here. No 3D simulation results changed from 1.1.0 for anything 1.1.0 could build. Saves move to
format 15.

### Added

- **A 2D module.** `bearing-physics/2d`: `World2D` and `Body2D`, in pixels with y down and angles
  clockwise, 100 px to the metre by convention, as Godot; metres with y up are a matter of setting
  gravity and density, since every tolerance follows body size. Box, circle, capsule, polygon and
  compound bodies weigh, move, turn and take forces. They collide, stack, slide, bounce and roll,
  by the 3D solver's method, and thousands at once sleep and cost nothing. A `tilemap` takes
  Winding's numbers, costs nothing for its size, has no seams to catch on, and changes with
  `world.setTile`; a `chain` is a one-sided line for slopes. Rays, shape casts, overlap tests,
  contact events with impacts, and sensors work as in 3D. A `character` body walks, climbs tile
  steps and slopes, rides what it stands on and pushes with a `pushForce`, and `world.groundOf`
  says what it stands on. Joints, continuous collision, save and load, debug lines and workers
  aren't in it yet. See [the 2D reference](docs/API-2D.md).
- **Elliptical joint cones.** A ball or rotation joint's `cone` takes two angles, `[toward, across]`:
  how far `axis` may swing toward the new option `swing`, and at right angles to it, as a shoulder
  swings further forward than up. Its edge is a rim the axis slides round, as a frictionless one
  would. `swing` defaults to the world's x, y or z most at right angles to `axis`. One angle is
  the round cone as before, to the bit.
- **Characters can push.** Body option `pushForce`, characters only: the most a character pushes a
  dynamic body it walks into with, in newtons, so a player shoves a crate along as Jolt's
  characters do. It still stops at the crate each step, as at a wall, and follows as it gives way.
  The default, 0, pushes nothing, as before.
- **`lockPosition`.** Body option, the partner of `lockRotation`: the world axes a body's centre of
  mass never moves along. It keeps a 3D scene on one plane whatever hits it, and makes wheels on
  fixed axles, lifts and sliding doors from one option.

### Changed

- `world.step`'s notes say that the first steps to meet something new run slower while the
  JavaScript engine compiles them (31 ms against 3.5 ms for a ball hitting a jointed wall), and to
  step a small scene while a game loads.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-03

What games need first from 1.x, added without changing anything 1.0 code relies on. A hit
between bodies already touching is now an event, so damage can be read from every blow; a group
keeps each ragdoll's parts off one another, a hundred ragdolls at once; queries leave out a list
of bodies; and `body.moveTo` drives an animated kinematic body to a pose, exactly. No simulation
results changed from 1.0.0. Saves move to format 12, and as before load only into the version
that made them.

### Added

- **Impact events.** `world.contacts()` gives `{ type: 'impact', a, b, point, normal, speed }`, a
  begin's fields, when two bodies already touching meet again: a box sliding on a level mesh into a
  wall of the same mesh, which gave no event at all before, or a sword resting on a shield swung
  into it. It comes when the pair's fastest closing speed rose since the last step by more than a
  bounce too small to see, so steady pressing gives none. Every hit is now a begin or an impact.
  The save format is 11.
- **Groups.** Body option `group`: bodies of the same group never collide with each other,
  whatever their layers, so a hundred ragdolls can each keep their own parts apart, which 32
  layers can't. Any whole number, a body's `id` included; `0`, the default, is none. It holds for
  contacts, sensors and characters. The save format is 12.
- **`ignore` takes a list.** `raycast`, `raycastAll`, `shapeCast` and `overlap` leave out every body
  in a list given as `ignore`, such as a ragdoll's own parts, as well as one body as before. A
  wrong value says so: `ignore must be a Body or a list of Bodies, got …`, `ignore[1] must be a
  Body, got …`.
- **`body.moveTo(position, rotation, dt)`.** Sets the velocities that bring a body to a pose over
  the next step, so an animated kinematic body (a door, an arm, a platform on a path) pushes what
  it meets as it goes. A kinematic body lands on the pose to rounding, its turn worked out with
  Bearing's own sine, cosine and arctangent, as Box2D 3's `b2Body_SetTargetTransform` and Jolt's
  `MoveKinematic` do it but exact.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-03

Bearing 1.0. The whole API was gone through before it, as Winding's was, so that code written
against it keeps working through 1.x: a few names were made to mean one thing each (the old ones
throw, saying what they are called now), what each call gives back was made to round-trip, and
the API reference now says exactly what 1.x promises and what it doesn't. The determinism hash is
checked on Bun as well as Node, and CI runs only the tests a change reaches. No simulation results
changed from 0.14.0.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `body.centerOfMass`, where a body's mass is centred in the world, is now
  `body.worldCenterOfMass`, as Winding's is `node.worldPosition()`, so that `centerOfMass` means
  one thing: the option, in the body's own frame, which keeps its name. Reading or assigning the old
  property throws, saying so.
- **Breaking:** a joint's `friction` option is now `frictionForce`, the same N·m or N, paired with
  `motorForce`; a body's `friction`, a coefficient, keeps its name. Giving a joint `friction`
  throws, saying so, and `jointOf` gives `frictionForce`.
- **Breaking:** "not set" reads back one way. `bodyOf` always gives `inertia` (and, but for a
  character, `centerOfMass`) where the body can have them, and a character's `stepHeight`, as
  `null` while they follow their worked-out default; `jointOf` always gives `min` and `max` where
  the joint has them, `null` for the default. `null` is the default wherever the default is worked
  out or none, as the API reference's Conventions now say once.
- **Breaking:** the TypeScript type `Shape` is now `ShapeType`, beside `BodyType` and `JointType`.
  `Vec3` and `Quat` take any array-like of numbers, a plain `number[]` included, as the reference
  always said; what Bearing gives back is still a tuple.
- **Breaking:** error messages made one form. A property names itself in all of its errors
  (`world.gravity: this world was destroyed`, `body.position: this body was removed`,
  `joint.force: this joint was removed`). A Body or Joint given to any call is checked by one rule
  with one set of messages: `<name> must be a Body, got …`, `<name> belongs to another world`,
  `<name> was removed` (`setBody: body was removed`, `addJoint: b belongs to another world`,
  `remove: handle belongs to another world`). A query shape's own fields are named as its own:
  `shapeCast: shape: unknown option 'radus' (did you mean 'radius'?)`, `shapeCast: shape.radius
  must be a positive number, got -1`.
- A save is stamped with the version of Bearing that made it, and loads only into that version:
  `load: this data was saved by Bearing 0.14.0, and this is …; a save loads only into the version
  that made it`. Its format is 10.

### Added

- `world.joint(id)`, a handle for a joint's id, as `world.body(id)` is for a body's.
- `world.save()` data carries `version`, the Bearing that saved it.
- The API reference's "What 1.x promises": what code written against it can rely on through 1.x
  (every call, option, default's meaning, return shape and unit; bad input throwing and changing
  nothing), and what it can't (simulation bits across versions, measured figures, documented
  limitations, error wording, new kinds and fields, modules by path, how ids are laid out), and
  its Renamed section. From 1.0, a name renamed in 1.x keeps working until 2.0.
- The reference lists every type the package exports.

### Fixed

- `setBody(body, bodyOf(body))` and `setJoint(joint, jointOf(joint))` change nothing, and
  `addBody(bodyOf(body))` and `addJoint(jointOf(joint))` make copies, with nothing lost to a field
  left out. `setJoint` takes `a` and `b` given as they are, and an `anchor`, `anchorB` or `axis`
  given as it already is changes nothing, so a joint given back what `jointOf` read keeps its angle
  and what it carried, mid-swing.
- A distance joint's `length: null` goes back to its default, how far apart its ends are now.
- `jointOf().axis` is the axis as it was given, made unit length, not worked out again from how
  the bodies have turned, which read it back a rounding off.
- `raycast`, `raycastAll`, `shapeCast` and `overlap` given a removed body as `ignore` throw, as
  every other call given a removed body does, rather than ignoring nothing.
- A hinge given a rotation as its `target` is told its target must be a number, not that it must
  be from -π to π.
- The reference: "centre" means one point each time (`setPosition` moves the origin; anchors'
  defaults, and a force or impulse with no point, are at the centre of mass; `velocity` is the
  centre of mass's); `bodyOf`'s Returns names every field, a hull's `vertices` and a compound's
  `parts` included; the Body entry says what still works on a removed body; a distance joint's
  `min` and `max` default to its `length`; `world.contacts(body?)`; stale lines on joints,
  contacts and stay events.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-11-02

The first release. Bearing is a 3D physics engine in plain JavaScript, for any renderer, with no
dependencies and no build step, and this brings everything built so far: dynamic, static,
kinematic and character bodies of boxes, balls, capsules, convex hulls and compounds; triangle
meshes and heightfields, read from `.glb` too; contacts that stack, friction, bounces and
continuous collision; sleeping; raycasts, shape casts and overlap tests; contact events and
sensors; fixed, ball, hinge, slider, distance and rotation joints with stops, motors, springs,
friction, pose targets and the force each one carries; save and load; and workers. The same
inputs give the same results to the bit on every machine and with any number of workers. It is
numbered 0.14.0 because that is where the roadmap's plan puts the API, and before 1.0 a minor
version may still change it.

### Added

- Joints are solved on the workers too: joints that share no moving body, and whole joint trees,
  go to different threads, each body taking its pushes in the same order as on one thread, so the
  results are the same to the bit with any number of workers. With that and work kept from one
  pass to the next, 100 ragdolls standing on their motors step in about 6 ms instead of 26 on an
  i7-1260P (18 to 21 ms on one thread), and ragdolls and chains are faster on one thread too.
- `new World({ gravity })`, with `world.gravity`, `world.bodyCount`, `world.step(dt)` and
  `world.destroy()`. A step is exactly `dt` seconds of semi-implicit Euler: gravity for dynamic
  bodies, velocity for dynamic and kinematic ones.
- Bodies: `world.addBody`, `world.setBody`, `world.bodyOf`, `world.remove` and `world.body(id)`.
  Box, sphere and capsule shapes, with mass from the shape's volume and a density (water's by
  default) unless a mass is given. Dynamic, static and kinematic types.
- `Body` handles: `id`, `slot`, `world`, `alive`, `mass`, read-only copies of `position`,
  `rotation`, `velocity` and `angularVelocity`, and the chaining setters `setPosition`,
  `setRotation`, `setAxisAngle`, `setEuler`, `setVelocity` and `setAngularVelocity`.
- `world.transforms` and `world.previous`: every body's position and rotation as one
  `Float32Array`, now and before the last step, for any renderer to copy and interpolate.
- Ids that can never reach the wrong body: a 24-bit slot and a 29-bit generation in one exact
  number. Storage that grows as bodies are added and shrinks as they go.
- Bit-identical results on every machine: nothing in Bearing calls an implementation-approximated
  function, and rotations from angles use Bearing's own sine and cosine.
- Every error names its call, its option, what it must be and what it got, and an unknown option
  suggests the nearest real one.
- Inertia from the shape and mass, about the body's own axes, or an `inertia` option to give your
  own; `body.inertia` reads it.
- Lopsided bodies tumble as real ones do: a box spun about its middle axis flips over. A step
  carries angular momentum across exactly, so it is kept to rounding, and energy can only fall,
  so a fast spin never blows up.
- Forces and impulses: `body.applyForce(force, point)` and `body.applyTorque(torque)` act for the
  next step; `body.applyImpulse(impulse, point)` and `body.applyAngularImpulse(impulse)` act at
  once. Static and kinematic bodies are not moved by them.
- Collision. Every pair of box, sphere and capsule gets exact contact points, found before the
  shapes touch, and a soft-step solver keeps them apart: bodies rest, stack, slide and bounce. A
  210-box pyramid stands within a tenth of a millimetre of where it was built (contact points keep
  their names from step to step even where faces line up exactly, so each keeps what it carried
  over); a box on a slope holds until tan θ
  passes its friction and then slides at exactly g (sin θ − μ cos θ); balls with restitution 1 keep
  their momentum and energy. Kinematic bodies push dynamic ones and carry what stands on them.
- Body options `friction` (0.5), `restitution` (0), `damping`, `angularDamping` and `gravityScale`.
  Friction mixes as a geometric mean, restitution as the larger. Friction is worked out once for
  each contact, at the centre of its points, with turning about the normal resisted by the
  points' spread (Box3D's way). Friction that holds also pulls
  back any slip the solver let through, so a settled heap stays where it settled and goes to
  sleep: the benchmark's 1,000 boxes were 883 awake for good, at 45 ms a step, and now all sleep.
- `world.substeps` (8), the one solver setting, measured rather than chosen: the fewest that keep
  the pyramid within half a box's tolerance.
- Every contact tolerance comes from the size of the bodies touching (a two-hundredth of the
  smaller one's thinnest size, about a pixel), so a 1 cm marble and a 50 m building both settle
  with nothing retuned.
- Thousands of bodies: a broadphase finds which bodies might touch without testing every pair.
  Bodies sit in a tree of boxes, and only a body that moves out of its box is looked up again, so
  a pile at rest costs almost nothing to keep. No world bounds and nothing to size.
- Body options `layers` and `mask`: 32 collision layers as bits. Two bodies collide when each one's
  layers are in the other's mask; by default everything collides with everything.
- Sleeping. Touching bodies form islands, and an island whose bodies have all strayed less than a
  pixel in every second for a second goes to sleep: left out of every step, at no cost, until
  something disturbs it. Anything that does wakes it, with nothing to call: a touch, any setter,
  force or impulse, `setBody`, removing or moving what it rests on, or changing `world.gravity`.
  10,000 boxes asleep step in a few microseconds. `world.sleeping` (on by default) switches it off,
  and `body.asleep` says whether a body is.
- Balls and capsules roll and spin to a stop. Every contact is a patch as wide as its tolerance,
  which resists rolling and spinning as a real one does: a rolling resistance of 0.01 for any ball
  or capsule, so a ball rolled at 1 m/s rolls 7.1 m and stops, at any size. A fast-rolling ball
  also stays on the floor: the solver now follows a ball's contact by its centre, not by a point
  on its surface that rolled up and away.
- Queries. `world.raycast(origin, direction, options)` finds the nearest body a ray meets, and
  `world.raycastAll` every one, nearest first, each as `{ body, point, normal, distance }`.
  `world.shapeCast(shape, origin, direction, options)` slides a sphere, box or capsule and finds
  the first body it would touch, stopping within a pixel of it and never past it.
  `world.overlap(shape, position, options)` lists the bodies a shape placed there overlaps. Each
  takes `mask` and `ignore`; rays and casts take `maxDistance`. Queries see the world as it is
  between steps, walk the broadphase's tree, and never change what the world does. 10,000 rays into
  1,000 boxes take 73 ms on the laptop.
- `world.moved(since)`: the slots of the bodies an engine has to draw again since it last drew at
  step `since`, exact however many steps ran in between, so a world of sleeping bodies copies
  nothing. `world.stepCount` counts the steps.
- Triangle meshes and heightfields, for level geometry: `addBody({ shape: 'mesh', vertices,
  indices })` and `addBody({ shape: 'heightfield', heights, columns, spacing })`, static unless
  made kinematic. Every shape collides with their triangles, from either side, and the seams
  between triangles can't be caught on: a box slides across a floor of 800 triangles on exactly
  the path it takes across one box, and a ball rolls over a wavy heightfield without leaving it.
  Only the triangles under a body are looked at, about 17 a step for a box on 100,000 of them.
  Rays, shape casts and overlap tests see them too.
- `readGlb(bytes, options)`: every triangle of a `.glb` file's scene, or of one named node, placed
  as the scene places it, ready for a mesh body. No dependency; a file compressed with Draco or
  meshopt throws, naming the extension to export without.
- A kinematic body moving however slowly stays awake. Measured by how far it had strayed, a 10 m
  platform at 1 cm/s counted as still, fell asleep and stopped; now one is still only when its
  velocities are zero.
- Contact events. `world.contacts(body)` lists the last step's events: a `begin` when two bodies
  start touching, with where, which way and how fast they met, and an `end` when they stop. Read
  after the step, never called back from inside it, so anything can be changed while reading. A
  pair touches when the solver pushed it in the step or the step left it within a pixel. Given a
  body, only its events, turned so it is `a`. Removed bodies' touches end at the next step.
- `world.touching(body)`: every body touching it now, through the broadphase tree, for "is the
  player on the ground?" without a stay event per touching pair per step.
- Sensors: `addBody({ sensor: true })`, any shape and type. A sensor reports what overlaps it and
  pushes nothing; bodies pass through it on exactly the path they'd take without it. Sensors see
  every body but other sensors, never two static bodies, wake nothing, and queries pass through
  them. Events and sensors cost nothing when nothing changes.
- Character bodies: `addBody({ type: 'character' })`, moved at the velocity the game gives it, as a
  kinematic body is, but colliding as a person walking does. It slides along walls, walks up ground
  no steeper than `maxSlope` (45° by default) at the speed it is given, steps up onto anything no
  taller than `stepHeight` (a ninth of its height), stays on the ground going down slopes and
  stairs, falls under gravity in the air and lands, and rides what it stands on. Its velocity reads
  what it did: the part into a wall goes, and landing stops the fall. `world.groundOf(body)` says
  what it stands on, where, and how steep. It reads no input; physics engines call this a character
  controller.
- `lockRotation: [x, y, z]` on any body: the world axes it never turns about. `[true, false, true]`
  keeps a dynamic capsule upright; `[true, true, false]` keeps a 2.5D game's bodies turning only in
  their plane, where they also stay, to the bit.
- Joints: `world.addJoint`, `world.setJoint`, `world.jointOf`, `world.jointCount`, and `Joint`
  handles (`id`, `world`, `alive`, `destroy()`), removed by `world.remove(joint)` or with either of
  their bodies. Fixed, ball, hinge, slider and distance joints, between two bodies or a body and a
  point in the world, placed in world space. Hinges and sliders have limits and motors, ball joints
  a twist limit and a cone, and a distance joint is a rod, a rope or a spring. A joint's angle,
  position and motor are its `a`'s against its `b`. Joined bodies don't collide unless `collide`
  says they do, sleep and wake together, and a character doesn't walk into what is joined to it.
- Chains, ragdolls and bridges are solved exactly: joints that join bodies into trees are solved
  all together every pass (Baraff's linear-time method), so a 100-link chain hangs at its built
  length from the first step and a weight 100 times a link's mass doesn't stretch it. Limits are
  solved against their own joint's pin, so a slammed door stops on its stop.
- Joints have the last word in each pass, after the contacts, so a contact's push on one limb is
  shared with the whole body the joints tie it to. Solved the other way, limbs at rest rattled and
  32 ragdolls never slept; now their joints hold within a tenth of a millimetre and they sleep
  once nothing in them still swings.
- A chain hung from a turning kinematic body and swept into a post, other chains or a heap of
  boxes passes through or pushes past them instead of being flung: a tree of joints held to
  something that can't move, while it touches anything, starts each substep from none of last
  substep's impulses, which no longer balanced the contacts', and its bodies are no longer caught
  alone at a wall.
  Eight links on a plate turning at 0.5 to 10 rad/s, among hanging chains and boxes, now go no
  faster than 1.75 times the same chain with nothing in its way; before, they were flung past
  1,000 m/s at 1.5 to 7 rad/s.
- A chain whipped round fast, touching nothing, keeps its joints shut. The joints were solved
  with the inertia each body had as the step began, though their anchors follow it as it turns;
  a link spinning a few tenths of a radian a substep took a pull at its end as turning it about
  its own length. Eight links on a plate turning at 10 rad/s opened their joints by 4.9 m; now
  26 mm. The joints now take each body's inertia where it has turned to; the contacts keep the
  step's.
- A long box lying on one slope of a ridge, an end past the crest, rests there. Its centre was
  below the far slope's plane, carried back under it, so that slope's triangles were touched from
  below and pressed it 0.3 m down into the slope it lay on: wedged, it took up to 15 s to sleep
  on a mesh and a heightfield alike (22 and 21 of 300 drops of a 2 m box had such a contact; now
  none, and the slowest sleeps in 5.4 and 7.9 s). A box's or hull's part over a triangle now
  decides the side when the triangle's own face stands in for the shape's.
- A heightfield has one side: it is ground, and pushes everything under its surface up out of it,
  along its own +y, which turns with the body, so a heightfield turned over is a ceiling. Two-sided,
  a body pressed in past its centre was pushed down through it by a triangle beside it whose plane
  passed over that centre: a rock at the bottom of a 288-body heap fell through the ground for good.
  Meshes keep two sides. A heightfield given negative heights and gravity up to stand for a ceiling
  now needs turning over instead.
- A box's or hull's corner pressed into a valley of a mesh or heightfield could go through it.
  Under the seam of a fold inward, a corner is over neither face, and each face left it out, so
  nothing held it: a rock pressed into a valley by a heap sank 0.5 m in ten steps. Such a corner
  is now held by both faces.
- Ragdolls with joint friction settle every time. Two boxes lying flat on each other, such as a
  ragdoll's thigh on its own forearm, can swap which face the contact is clipped against from one
  step to the next, and their points were named by that face, so every swap lost the points'
  impulses: the thigh dropped onto the forearm and bounced, and the ragdoll buzzed in place at up
  to 6 cm/s for good. 6 of 20 starts of the 32 joint-friction ragdolls never slept; now all 20
  sleep by 5.9 s. A box contact's points are now named by what of each box made them.
- Hulls lying flat on hulls or boxes keep their contact points' impulses when the face the
  contact is clipped against swaps, as boxes do: their points are now named by what of each
  shape made them. In ragdolls made of hulls, a chest lying flat on the floor buzzed at 5 cm/s
  and kept its ragdoll awake to 21 s in 1 of 12 starts; now all 12 sleep by 6.25 s.
- Each substep's solving pass reads every contact point's separation from the relaxing pass before
  it, which left the bodies exactly where the solving pass finds them, instead of working it out
  again: the same results to the bit, and the 1,000-box pile steps about 4% faster, the pyramid
  5.6%, a pile of hulls 2.7%.
- The contact solve reads its columns once a pass instead of once a manifold: the same results to
  the bit, and the 1,000-box pile steps about 31% faster, the pyramid 40%, hulls 30%, boxes on
  terrain 28% and ragdolls 8%; 10,000 boxes falling, 230 to 170 ms a step on one thread.
- The contacts' preparing and warm-start passes do the same: the pile, the pyramid, hulls and boxes
  on terrain about 9 to 16% faster again, to the bit.
- A contact's separation is measured with its normal turned into each body's frame, once a
  manifold, instead of each point's two anchors turned out of it: two turns a manifold where a box
  face took eight. Equal but for rounding (a pyramid's boxes end within a micrometre of where they
  did); the pile about 2 to 3.5% faster, the pyramid 3.5 to 5%, hulls 1 to 2.5%.
- A box face's four contact points pushing together are solved with the block's elimination written
  out: the same results to the bit, the pyramid about 9% faster and the pile 3%.
- A tree of joints keeps the factor of its equations from one substep to the next while none of its
  bodies has turned more than 0.071 rad since it was made (or it hangs from two or more fixed
  points), instead of factoring them afresh every substep: ragdolls step 11 to 19% faster and
  hanging chains 20 to 26%. Joints hold as before, within a few tenths of a millimetre; ragdolls
  with joint friction settle about 0.7 s later (5.6 to 6.3 s).
- The world and its contact store name every column when they are made, instead of adding them in a
  loop by computed name, which left both as hash tables in V8, every read of a column a lookup.
  The same results to the bit, and every scene faster: the pile and pyramid about 20 to 25%, hulls
  23 to 29%, terrain 15 to 19%, raycasts 11 to 14%, ragdolls 9%. A loaded world is made the same
  way, and a test fails if any of its stores falls back to a hash table.
- Hulls skip the separating axes that can't win (Catto's inscribed spheres): each hull keeps the
  radius of a ball inside it, and a face, or an edge along its whole arc, that the ball proves comes
  out below the best face already measured isn't measured. The same results to the bit. On 1,000
  rocks, 79% of face tests and 91% of edge pairs are skipped, and 70% of rocks' edge axes against
  terrain triangles: hulls on terrain step 21 to 28% faster, the rock pile 1 to 2%. Saved worlds
  are now format 6.
- Every pair of boxes, balls, capsules and hulls keeps its contact from step to step while its two
  bodies barely move against each other, not only pairs with a hull, and a pair still touching
  keeps it until either body has moved half a contact tolerance against the other, so a kept
  contact's depth is never off by more than a fresh one may be. On the settling 1,000-box pile,
  72% fewer contacts are found afresh, and the pile and pyramid step 8 to 10% faster. A jointed
  body's contacts are always found afresh: a ragdoll's light limbs rock onto corners a kept contact
  misses. The workers leave such pairs alone instead of finding a contact that would be thrown away.
- Part of an island can stop while the rest of it moves: a body stopped for a second, whose
  neighbours and theirs are too, is frozen, its contacts with frozen and static bodies left
  unsolved, and the whole frozen piece starts again as soon as anything within two contacts of it
  moves or is set by hand. The settling 1,000-box pile solves 73% of the contact points it did,
  its 15 s take 19% less time (the last 5 s 62% less), and it is all asleep at 12.5 s instead of
  14. With both, the pile's 15 s take 35% less time (8.4 to 5.5 s) and it is all asleep at 10.5 s.
  Saved worlds are now format 7.
- Pose motors: a joint's motor can drive to a `target`, a hinge's angle, a slider's position, or
  a ball joint's turn of `a` against `b`, as a spring with a `frequency` and `dampingRatio` (as a
  distance joint's), no stronger than `motorForce` (0 is a motor off: a target with no force does
  nothing). Solved inside the step, so it is steady however stiff: a knocked limb springs back at
  its frequency (1.00008 s at 1 Hz), a motor too weak for its load gives, and the benchmark's
  ragdoll stands on its own feet with every joint driven to its pose, within 0.32 mm for 10 s. A
  hinge's or slider's `motorSpeed` with a target is how fast the target moves, so one moved each
  step is followed without lagging (1.4e-7 rad against a step's turn without). A new `'rotation'`
  joint holds how `a` is turned against `b`, or the world, leaving it free to move, or with a
  motor drives that turn, its `cone` a hard stop: a ragdoll's pelvis kept upright this way stands
  through a 60 N·s shove that topples it without. Joints with no target keep their bits. Saved
  worlds are now format 8.
- Joint forces: `joint.force` and `joint.torque`, read after a step: the mean force (N) and
  torque (N·m, about its anchor on `a`) the joint pushed `a` with over the step, everything it did
  counted, as games need to break joints. Every impulse is counted along the row it was solved
  with, in every pass, so a jerk shows in full: a 1 kg ball dropped 0.9 m onto a rope reads 255 N
  in the step it goes taut, and 9.81 N hanging. A sleeping joint keeps its last. The same with any
  number of workers. Saved worlds are now format 9.
- Joint friction: `friction` on ball joints, hinges and sliders, the most torque (N·m) or force
  (N) the joint resists turning or sliding with, as a stiff hinge does. A hinge's or slider's is
  its motor held at speed 0, to the bit; a ball joint's resists turning every way alike. 32 ragdolls
  with 1 N·m on every joint all sleep within 6 s, where without it 286 of their 352 parts still
  swing at 12 s. None by default. Saved worlds are now format 5.
- Fixed: a hinge's or slider's motor turned off with `setJoint(joint, { motorForce: 0 })` went on
  pushing as hard as it last had, at every substep: a wheel kept speeding up.
- `world.remove(handle)` takes a body or a joint; its error is now `remove: handle must be a Body or
  a Joint, got …`.
- Bearing's own `atan` and `atan2` in `core/math.js`, exact operations only, within 1 ulp of
  `Math.atan2`, for joint angles that are the same on every machine.
- Fast bodies meet where they would meet. A pair not yet touching that moves against itself by
  more than its tolerance in a step is asked when its shapes would touch, following each body's
  velocity, gravity and spin (conservative advancement), and gets its contact at that moment, or
  none. A ball passing a corner with room to spare, or through a gap wider than itself, keeps its
  velocity exactly, where before it could be stopped at any speed; a 10 cm rod at 200 m/s spinning
  at up to 80 rad/s stops on a 2 cm wall, where before it passed 28 times in 50. Nothing to flag
  and no option; pairs at rest never ask.
- Nothing fast goes through. A body struck hard off its centre is spun up within a substep and
  turned through a thin wall where its contacts don't reach: rods turned any way went through a
  1 cm wall 57 times in 100. Now, after the solve, a body whose centre moved more than half its
  thinnest size sweeps a small ball at its centre along its path, against everything but other
  fast bodies, as they end the step; if the ball meets something, the body goes back to where it
  did, with its velocity into the surface returned as restitution would. Rods, cubes and planks
  turned any way, spinning or not, at 50 to 500 m/s, now pass none of a thin wall, a mesh, a
  heightfield or a thin plate floating free.
- A body other than a sphere spins at most half a turn a step, π / dt rad/s, 188 rad/s at 60 Hz.
  Faster, its contacts missed the sides it turned onto: a 10 cm rod spun at 400 rad/s gained energy
  from them until it reached 9,600 rad/s, and a chain of thin boxes whipping its end blew apart.
- Contact events: a touch the step couldn't foresee now also includes a spinning box meeting with a
  corner its contact didn't hold, and comes a step late like the others.
- Fixed: GJK called two shapes 0.22 mm apart touching when its last four points lay flat, which made
  a rod's time of impact stop short.
- Convex hulls: `shape: 'hull'` with `vertices`, any points, three numbers each. The hull is the
  smallest convex solid round them (quickhull), with points inside it or on its edges and faces
  dropped and faces lying in one plane merged, so a cube's 8 corners make 6 square faces and a cube
  made as a hull stacks exactly as a box does. Its mass, centre of mass and inertia are exact.
  Hulls collide with every shape, meshes and heightfields included, by separating axes and
  clipping.
- Compound bodies: `shape: 'compound'` with `parts`, boxes, spheres, capsules and hulls placed from
  the body's origin as one rigid body, each with its own `density` if given. Their masses,
  centres and inertias are summed exactly.
- A body's centre of mass can be off its origin: a hull's and a compound's are worked out, and the
  body turns about it. `body.centerOfMass` says where it is in the world. `position` and
  `world.transforms` stay at the origin, so a renderer draws a model where its file puts it.
  `velocity` is the centre of mass's. A lopsided body's inertia is about its principal axes,
  found exactly when it is made, and `body.inertia` gives the moments about them.
- `world.save()` and `World.load(data)`: the whole world as plain, JSON-safe data, and back, so a
  loaded world steps exactly as the saved one would have, to the bit, with the same ids. For
  replays, tests, checkpoints and bug reports that reproduce.
- `world.debugLines(options)`: the world as line segments in one `Float32Array`, nine numbers each
  (two ends and a colour), for any engine to draw: collision shapes, the last step's contacts,
  joints, and the broadphase's boxes.
- Hulls always touch where they overlap: the face a hull is clipped against is taken at its
  deepest corner, and a face that ties with a better axis is used only if its points hold the
  overlap. Before, two hulls overlapping by centimetres could get no contact for a step, and heaps
  of hulls kicked and stayed awake (4 of 16 never slept in 60 s; now all sleep, median 6 s).
- Hulls on meshes and heightfields take the same face at their deepest corner. Before, a rock
  pressed into terrain got points 1 to 4 cm shallower than it was, or none (thousands of cases
  over a few heaps; now tens, all fast arrivals or corners under a valley seam).
- A body on a mesh or heightfield steps the same whatever was stepped before it. Contacts on
  terrain took the carried-back offsets of the last pair that had an impact, even one in another
  world, so a box on a mesh could rest 6 mm from where it rests in a fresh process.
- Hull pairs that have barely moved against each other since the last step keep their contact
  instead of finding it again, within the tolerance a fresh one is found to: a pile of 1,000 hulls
  steps 30% faster. Saved worlds are now format 3; format 2 data is refused.
- Bodies no longer rock for good. A contact keeps at most four points, and they were chosen for
  how far apart they lie, so points a few millimetres off could push out the one a body rested
  on; the body sank there unheld, the overlap was pushed back out when the points changed, and
  each push lifted it. Points pressing are now chosen first, then those touching, then the rest,
  and a hull's deepest point is left out only while the four kept hold its weight up. Rocks and
  boxes on a bumpy mesh: 17 of 48 heaps never slept, now none (median 36 s to 7 s); the
  1,000-box pile's one never-sleeping start now sleeps in 11 s. A rock lying face to face on another,
  its weight over the middle of three pressed points, rocked between them; the four now start
  from the pressed point under its weight.
- Boxes slide over rippled meshes and heightfields as they should. Every fold between triangles,
  however slight, could give a contact whose normal pointed along the ground, and a sliding box
  hit it like a wall: on ripples of half a millimetre, a box 2° past friction's hold slid 0.9 m
  in 4 s where it should slide 3.06; now 3.14. A contact at a triangle's edge now counts only if
  its normal lies between that face and the face across the edge, as a contact at a seam already
  did. Saved worlds are now format 4 (meshes keep each edge's fold); format 3 data is refused.
- Friction at its limit pushes straight against the slide. A corner resting alone turns as it is
  pushed, and friction scaled straight down to its limit leaned up to 22° off the slide, so a box
  on rippled ground half a degree short of friction's hold crept on for good; now it stays put.
- A contact's points are pushed apart together, as one small problem solved exactly, instead of
  one after another four times over: the 1,000-box pile steps 5 to 6% faster and the pyramid 13 to
  17%, with stacks, slopes and sleeping as before.
- Contacts are solved in groups that share no moving body, ready for solving on several threads
  later. Results change in their last digits, and are still the same on every machine.
- `new World({ workers })` and `world.workers`: a world shares each step's contact work with
  threads of its own, `'auto'` by default, with results the same to the bit as on one thread. A
  landing pile of 1,000 boxes steps 3.2 times as fast on an i7-1260P laptop, 8,000 boxes 3.4
  times. They start by themselves once a world has enough contacts, sleep between steps, and end
  with `destroy()`. In a browser they need a cross-origin isolated page; without one, or with
  `workers: 0`, everything runs on one thread as before. Joints are solved on one thread, and the workers
  sleep through them rather than spin: 32 ragdolls stepped 1.6 times as slow with workers as
  without before that, and now 1.15 times.
- The `centerOfMass` option, `[x, y, z]` in the body's own frame or `null` for the shape's, moves
  any body's centre of mass, as a car's is lowered so it doesn't roll over.
- Documentation. The README says what Bearing is and isn't, with the measured comparison against
  Rapier, Jolt and cannon-es, its method and machine, where Bearing is ahead and where it is
  behind, how to load it before it is on npm, what its determinism promises and how that is
  tested, and its limitations. `docs/SIDE-BY-SIDE.md` has the same small program in Bearing,
  Rapier, cannon-es and Jolt, and what each asks for that Bearing works out. `docs/ENGINES.md`
  shows how Three.js, Babylon.js, PlayCanvas, Pixi and Winding copy `world.transforms` onto their
  objects, between steps and only for what moved. Every example in them runs in a test
  (`test/engines.test.js` runs the engine examples against stand-ins for each engine).
- Fixed in the API reference: `world.workers` now says the workers solve joints too, and when;
  a falling object of any shape is a hull or compound (it said compounds were still to come); and
  continuous collision doesn't make a sensor see a body that passes through it within a step (it
  said a later version would).
